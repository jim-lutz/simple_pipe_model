questions on when to start, don't assume start is at TC1
pay attention to start.

interpolates to second for reaching threshold

adjust offset to show initial flow time at TC2
TC2 is close to TC1. He used TC2 as the origin

More uncertainty for lower thresholds

Calculated AV/PV to various threshold temperature

fit slope of AV/PV to linear

Made a script to automate selection of groups and selection of thresholds

Initial temperature of all TCs close and WH is constant

for each threshold temp AV/PVs are basically linear 
because constant flow rate volume = time

Rise ratio depends on hot and cold temperatures

He will send be template he used.
