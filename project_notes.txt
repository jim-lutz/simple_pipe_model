    see http://happygitwithr.com/ to set up git repository
    follow her directions in the directory above, not here.
    
    in a trial read_pipe_data.R reads stuff in from a spreadsheet.
    will have to set range, 
    hopefully that won't have to be manually set different for each spreadsheet

    manually collect metadata on pipe testing spreadsheets.
    
    instead try getting tidyxl to read specific information from Sheet1 in each of the 
    spreadsheets https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/
    
    test on title
    
    went back to readxl
    was able to read meta data from all the spreadsheets
    don't have TC locations correct yet

   use the index of the file loop to test for CPVC
   first 4 fields look OK. Not sure what was being read for rest.
   
   found pluck() to pick elements out of a tibble.
   
   able to read all test info from spreadsheet headers.

   34RigidCUR47RawData1.xlsx
   Copy of 34RigidCUR47RawData1.xlsx
   all have the same title 
        3/4 RIGID CU RAW TEST DATA - ALL 1 SECOND DATA ?
    
   Seems to read data from 12PEXBareRawData2.xlsx
   still need to get the notes field 
   When set rows too high to catch all for spreadsheets it choked
   problems with dates because NOMINAL is in that column

    manually collect data and note ranges
    see pipe_data_ranges.csv
    
    in 12PEXBareRawData2.xlsx 10 temperatures for TC1 are 'NAN' 
    Coercing text to numeric in E58130 / R58130C5: 'NAN'
    
    maybe at this stage get each Sheet1 into it's own data.table
    then incremental cleanups.
    
    34CPVCBareRawData2.xlsx too big?
    use unbounded rectangles. read notes and data together. trim later
    
    Cu files have more columns of data        

    fix later
    =========
    timestamp is in Excel date format

    nominal & test flag as separate columns?
